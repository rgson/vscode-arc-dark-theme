# Arc-Dark for Visual Studio Code

An **Arc-Dark**-inspired theme for Visual Studio Code.

Based on [SolarLiner's Linux Themes for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/SolarLiner/vscode-arc-theme). Inspired by [horst3180's Arc Theme](https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme).


## Changes

- *Tweaked the colors used for syntax highlighting.*
  SolarLiner's original used a quite matte color scheme. The new color scheme is
  a bit more saturated, to match the (primarily blue) colored elements of the
  Arc-Dark theme.
